# Pragmata Pro Monodraw Support
[Monodraw] is a macOS app for laying out diagrams in ASCII art. By default, it
builds diagrams with spec-standard box drawing characters. These files define
custom Monodraw character palettes for quick access to Pragmata Pro's arrow
character sets and extended box drawing glyphs.

Using Monodraw, you can create diagrams in Pragmata Pro's character set without
having to depend on hard spaces for layout. The app's WYSIWGY tools and gridded
canvas make edits fast and easy.

## Installation
From the Monodraw <kbd>Extras</kbd> menu, select <kbd>Reveal Characters
Folder</kbd>. Monodraw will open its `Characters` directory in the Finder. Copy
`pragmatapro-arrows.json` and `pragmatapro-box-drawing.json` into the
`Characters` directory and restart the app.

## Usage
Select Monodraw's <kbd>Pencil</kbd> tool from the toolbar. The right-hand-side
panel should open to a grid of box drawing characters. Select <kbd>Pragmata Pro:
Box Drawing Extras</kbd> or <kbd>Pragmata Pro: Arrows</kbd> from the
<kbd>Palette</kbd> menu. Choose a glyph, then click and drag on the canvas to
draw.
